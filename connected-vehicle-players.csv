The vast majority of the sensor platforms that the company uses today are smartphones and battery-powered IoT devices that stick to the windshield of the vehicle and work in conjunction with the smartphone.

Our technology is mobile-centric, using the sensors on smartphones and optionally an Internet of Things device called the Tag. The Tag is windshield-mounted or dash-mounted, has no position or GPS sensors, and gathers no location data. CMT does not collect vehicle OEM data.

All data gathered is used on a first-party basis and is not sold or shared with 3rd parties or data exchanges. 

CMT uses location data in limited ways. CMT only uses location data to assess driver risk, identify if a car crash has occurred and where to send emergency services, and to reconstruct a crash afterwards. CMT never sells location data. CMT allows users to delete their data for specific trips or time ranges (including all data).” —Ryan McMahon, vice president of strategy."
